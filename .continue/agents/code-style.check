      Review the changed TypeScript files against these conventions from AGENTS.md:

      **Imports:**
      - Named imports preferred (not `import *`)
      - Type imports must be separate: `import type { X }`

      **Naming:**
      - camelCase for variables and functions
      - PascalCase for types, interfaces, classes, and exports

      **Async:**
      - Prefer async/await over raw promises

      **Error Handling:**
      - Try-catch blocks with proper cleanup
      - No silent failures (empty catch blocks)

      For each violation, leave a comment on the specific line explaining the issue and suggesting a fix.
